Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
11.	Write a python program to find the factorial of a number.
Ans- 
num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
factorial = 1 
if num == 0 or num==1: 
    print("The factorialy  of 0 is 1")
else: 
    for i in range(1, num + 1): 
        factorial = factorial * i 
    print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial)

12.	 Write a python program to find whether a number is prime or composite.
Ans- 
num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
flag = False 
if num == 1: 
    print(num, "is neither prime nor composite")
elif num > 1: 
    
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0: 
            flag = True
            
            break
    
    if flag:
        print(num, "is a composite number")
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")
else: 
    print(num, "is not a valid input")


13.	. Write a python program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.
Ans:
s= str(input("pls enter palindrome word: "))
def palindrome (s):
    return s == s[::-1]

print (palindrome (s))
output:
pls enter palindrome word: nitin
True

14.	Write a Python program to get the third side of right-angled triangle from two given sides.
Ans- import math

a = float(input("Enter the length of the first side: "))
b = float(input("Enter the length of the second side: "))

c = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

print("The length of the third side is:", c)
 Output:
Enter the length of the first side: 4
Enter the length of the second side: 3

15.	Write a python program to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string.
Ans- def freq(s):
    word = {}
    for i in s:
        if i in word:
            word[i] += 1
        else:
            word[i] = 1
    return word
s= str(input("enter any string"))
print(f"The frequency of each character in '{s}' is:")
print(freq(s))

output:
enter any stringmangal
The frequency of each character in 'mangal' is:
{'m': 1, 'a': 2, 'n': 1, 'g': 1, 'l': 1}
